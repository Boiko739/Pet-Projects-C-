# Pet-Projects-C-
Here are my own pet projects that was created in VS 2019
The idea was simple: I learned English with the book of grammar by Golicynskiy. There were a lot of excercises but I had no keys to them, so I found them in russian site (there is no enywhere, i searched carefully).
There were a lot of ads there and in the site icon was the flag of russia. I was triggered of it constantly so I decided to download all the files I need from there to use this site nomore.
Here is a reason why I did this little project.
Honestly, I did it ituitively))
